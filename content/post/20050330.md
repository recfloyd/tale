<pre>
Love was young
We saw beyond
A sky that had no limits
Much higher than the highest star
Beyond the furthest planet
We thought that we could change the world
And everything in it
But time ran out of endless hours
Gave into doubt
Were we just playing an endless game
That no one ever wins
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
Love and hate
Left up to fate
A life we took for granted
We couldn't stop our running from the things we always wanted
No long goodbyes
No tears to cry
And nothing to believe in
But now you're gone
We'll never know a love that's grown
Time took away
All that it gave to the two of us
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
When our hearts were young and nights were long
We'd let the morning sun kiss our eyes open
Precious dreams that we had now they are dead and gone
The promises we made have all been broken
If I could run away
Hide away
Forget the way I feel
But your memory keeps haunting me
Convincing me it's real
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
In my arms
In my life
Lovin' you is just a memory
Now you're not here
Now you're not here
With me now
In my arms
In my mind
In my life
</pre>
